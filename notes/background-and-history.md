# A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence

## Ancient Roots & Early Ideas
  - Greek myth of Talos. Chinese automata
  - Logic & formal reasoning (Aristotle, Leibniz)
  - Alan Turing (1936): Turing Machine
  - 1950: Turing Test ("Can machines think?")

## The Birth of AI (1950s-60s)
  - Dartmouth Conference (19560 - AI is born
  - Founders: McCarthy, Minsky, Simon Newell
  - Early successes: Logic Theorist, General Problem Solver
  - Optimism and initial funding boom

## AI Winters (1970s-80s)
  - Expectations not met
  - DARPA and Lighthill Report
  - Cuts to funding and credibility
  - Symbolic AI limitations exposed

## The Rise of Machine Learning (1990s-2000s)
  - Move from rule-based to statiscal approaches
  - Key event: IBM Deep Blue defeats Kasparov (1997)
  - Growth of data and computational power
  - Models: Decision Trees, SVMs, Ensemble Learning

## Deep Learning Revolution (2010s)
  - AlexNet (2012) wins ImageNet - breakthrough
  - GPU power + Big Data = neural network rebirth
  - Key milestone: AlphaGo beats Lee Sedol (2016)
  - AI powers speech, vision, and self-driving tech

## Generative AI & Foundation Models (2020s)
  - Transformers (2017): Key architectrual shift
  - GPT-2 to GPT-4 (OpenAI), Claude, Gemini
  - Text, images, code: Generative AI explosion
  - Real-world apps: ChatGPT, DALL-E, Copilot

## Challenges and Considerations
  - Bias and fairness
  - Explainability and hallucinations
  - Alignment and control
  - Regulatory and ethical debates
